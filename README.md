# Multicomponent-Distillation
Personal project created based on concepts from my CHE 200 class for multicomponent distillation. This programs requires the streamlit, matplotlib, and numpy libraries to function.
The calcultation process uses the Antoine equation to calculate the relative volatilities of the components, the quality of the feed, temperature of the feed, and its composition. It then takes the specified amount of 2 compontents that are refered to as key components that is desired out the top and the bottom and uses them to determine the initial stepping points and stopping points to solve the column. An important note is that this program operates on the assumptions that there is no heat transfer with the column, the amount of heavy non key out the top and light non key out the bottom is 0, and the vapour and liquid flows within the top and bottom are constant and only change at the feed point. The resulting graph shows the composition of the liquid (going down) or vapour (going up) at each stage and also provides the total number of stages needed to achieve the required seperation.
I would like to thank my CHE 200 professor Jeff Gostick for inspiring me to make this and helping me publish this!
